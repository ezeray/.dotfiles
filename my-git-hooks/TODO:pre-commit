# The main idea here is to ensure that before each commit, the files that
# were modified pass the following tests:
#
#  - linter: sqlfluff for our sql models in dbt
#  - for dbt models: dbt run & dbt test?
#  - for python code: linting and if there are tests run those tests -- how to
#      implement this.
